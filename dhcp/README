A very simple DHCP server.
THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

# client.py
This script will send a request for a ip address but will not apply it, it is for testing the server.

# server.py
This file will listen for a DHCP request and send back an IP address.
